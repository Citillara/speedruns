# Final Fantasy VII - Hardcore Challenge 

### Essential Guidelines

- **Permanence of Defeat:** If a character is defeated, their use is discontinued. If this character revives within the party, they must be defeated again.
- **Battle Item Prohibition:** Items can't be used during battle, although they are permitted outside of battle.
- **Limited Rest:** Each resting point (inns, free rests) may be utilized only once.
- **Restricted Actions in Random Battles:** In random battles, the only permissible action is to retreat. Stealing, manipulating, and similar actions are forbidden.
- **Battle Endurance:** Remaining in a battle to increase the Limit Break bar is acceptable, but escape must follow.
- **Non-Random Battle Flexibility:** Forced battles that aren't "random" are allowed (such as spiders in the Gi cave, soldiers in the Shinra mansion, etc).
- **Challenge Continuity:** If a game over occurs, or a mistake is made, the game cannot be loaded from a previous save. Instead, the challenge must restart from the beginning.
- **Save & Load Privileges:** Saving and loading the game is allowed when pausing gameplay.
- **Optional Rule Flexibility:** The Yuffie recruitment battle's validity within this ruleset is left to your discretion.

### Hard variant

- **No Forced Battles:** Even non-random battles can't be provoked. When a choice impacts the number of battles, always opt for the path with the least conflict.
- **Specific Prohibitions:** Avoid actions like using the stairs in the Shinra mansion, fighting only 2 spiders in the Gi cave, engaging with the Lost Number boss, initiating Yuffie recruit battle, and avoiding monster chests in the Temple of the Ancients.

### Hardcore variant

- **Total Item Ban:** Using items is not permitted, even outside of battle.
- **Restricted Rest:** You are only allowed to use inns or rest spots when the game mandates it.

### Planetary IQ variant

- **Exclusive Character Usage:** You may only control one character at any given time. Characters you defeat for this purpose do not count towards the permanence of defeat rule; you can revive and use them as long as you were the one to defeat them. You are allowed to swap your chosen character anytime, but not during a battle.
